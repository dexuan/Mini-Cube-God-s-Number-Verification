* God's Number of the second-order Rubik's Cube (Mini Cube)

[[./images/Mini_Cube.jpg]]

** What is God's Number?

The minimum number of steps required to solve the Rubik's Cube in any state is called the God's Number.

There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different possible states of the third-order Rubik's Cube, but they can all be restored within 20 steps, so the God's Number of the third-order Rubik's Cube is 20.

This code can prove that the God's Number of the second-order Rubik's Cube is 11.

** How does this code work?

Starting from the restored state of the second-order Rubik's Cube, 3,674,160 different states can be obtained after 11 steps, and the second-order Rubik's Cube has exactly (5040*2187)/3=3674160 states, so the God's Number of the second-order Rubik's Cube is 11.
